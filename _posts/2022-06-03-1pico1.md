#### (1) Obediant Cat
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). **Download flag**. \
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: Any hints about entering a command into the Terminal (such as the next one), will start with a '$'... everything after the dollar sign will be typed (or copy and pasted) into your Terminal.\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Just `cat` the flag in terminal prompt. Flag is captured. (The hint is in the name)

#### (2) Python Wrangling
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run **this Python script** using **this password** to get **the flag**?\
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: get the falg using wget command ...\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Just have all the files in one folder and run the python file with pw file passed as password. Flag is captured.

#### (3) Wave a flag
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? **This program** has extraordinarily helpful information...\
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: Make it executable with `chmod +x filename`\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Run the flag in bash environment. Flag is captured.

#### (4) Nice netcat
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: `$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 7449`, but it doesn't speak English...\
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: Run netcat, see ASCII\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Running netcat, we get comma separated numbers. Since ASCII is mentioned in the hint, these might be ASCII characters in their number format. Converting them to text provides the flag. Flag is captured.

#### (5) Static ain't always noise
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Can you look at the data in this binary: static? This BASH script might help! \
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Contents of Bash script file - 

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Attempting disassembly of $1 ..."

#This usage of "objdump" disassembles all (-D) of the first file given by 
#invoker, but only prints out the ".text" section (-j .text) (only section
#that matters in almost any compiled program...

objdump -Dj .text $1 > $1.ltdis.x86_64.txt


#Check that $1.ltdis.x86_64.txt is non-empty
#Continue if it is, otherwise print error and eject

if [ -s "$1.ltdis.x86_64.txt" ]
then
        echo "Disassembly successful! Available at: $1.ltdis.x86_64.txt"

        echo "Ripping strings from binary with file offsets..."
        strings -a -t x $1 > $1.ltdis.strings.txt
        echo "Any strings found in $1 have been written to $1.ltdis.strings.txt with file offset"

else
        echo "Disassembly failed!"
        echo "Usage: ltdis.sh <program-file>"
        echo "Bye!"
fi
```
Run the bash file after giving it executable permissions (chmod +x) with the static exec file. The log is outputted into different files. 

`ltdis.sh  static  static.ltdis.strings.txt  static.ltdis.x86_64.txt` - grep each of the files with contains output log information. pico flag will be available in the `static.ltdis.strings.txt` at some random line. Don't go reading and checking it manually because the file might be huge! Flag is captured.

#### (6) Tab, Tab, Attack
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: **Addadshashanammu.zip**\
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: After `unzip`ing, this problem can be solved with 11 button-presses...(mostly Tab)...\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: After `wget` the file, a zip file is obtained. That file has a directory and adirectory within it and so on. Here the challenege title hint is useful - keep pressing tab to autocomplete and at the end an script executable exists. Run it to get the flag. Flag is captured.

#### (7) Magikarp Ground Mission 
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `ee388b88` \
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: Finding a cheatsheet for bash would be really helpful! \
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: SSH into the instance and use `ls`, `cd` and `cat` appropriately to traverse through directories and read out flag contents. Flag is catured.

#### (8) Let's Warm Up
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII? \
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Covert 0x70 to decimal to get 112. Refer ASCII chart for printable characters for that number. Plag is captured. geddit? (*giggle giggle*)

#### (9) Warmed up
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: 61. Eeeasy

#### (10) 2Warm 
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: 101010 (2Warm, "2" - binary ohhhhhh)

#### (11) what's a net cat?
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 41120 to get the flag?\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Command `nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 41120` -> spits out flag, flag is captured.

#### (12) strings it
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Can you find the **flag** in file without running it?\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: The file strings is obtained is a ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable. Use **strings** command to get output. A lot is spit out. grep "pico", flag is captured.

#### (13) Bases
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: What does this `bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1` mean? I think it has something to do with bases.\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Maybe it has to do with base64 encoded characters. Decoding it gives `l3arn_th3_r0p35` which when passed as flag gives the right answer. Flag is captured.

#### (14) First Grep
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way. \
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: Grep man page
<span style="color: red;">Solution</span>: Just use grep on the file. Flag is captured.

#### (15) Codebook
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Run the Python script `code.py` in the same directory as `codebook.txt`.\
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: 1. On the webshell, use ls to see if both files are in the directory you are in, 2. The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: File `code.py` contains the following code -

```
import random
import sys

def str_xor(secret, key):
    #extend key to secret length
    new_key = key
    i = 0
    while len(new_key) < len(secret):
        new_key = new_key + key[i]
        i = (i + 1) % len(key)        
    return "".join([chr(ord(secret_c) ^ ord(new_key_c)) for (secret_c,new_key_c) in zip(secret,new_key)])

flag_enc = chr(0x13) + chr(0x01) + chr(0x17) + chr(0x07) + chr(0x2c) + chr(0x3a) + chr(0x2f) + chr(0x1a) + chr(0x0d) + chr(0x53) + chr(0x0c) + chr(0x47) + chr(0x0a) + chr(0x5f) + chr(0x5e) + chr(0x02) + chr(0x3e) + chr(0x5a) + chr(0x56) + chr(0x5d) + chr(0x45) + chr(0x5d) + chr(0x58) + chr(0x31) + chr(0x58) + chr(0x58) + chr(0x59) + chr(0x02) + chr(0x51) + chr(0x4c) + chr(0x5a) + chr(0x0c) + chr(0x13)

def print_flag():
  try:
    codebook = open('codebook.txt', 'r').read()
    
    password = codebook[4] + codebook[14] + codebook[13] + codebook[14] +\
               codebook[23]+ codebook[25] + codebook[16] + codebook[0]  +\
               codebook[25]
               
    flag = str_xor(flag_enc, password)
    print(flag)
  except FileNotFoundError:
    print('Couldn\'t find codebook.txt. Did you download that file into the same directory as this script?')

def main():
  print_flag()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
`Codebook.txt` contains ```azbycxdwevfugthsirjqkplomn```

Run the python code by making the file executable and having the codebook.txt file in the same direcotry and it spits out the flag. Flag is captured.

#### (16) convert.py
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Run the Python script and convert the given number from decimal to binary to get the flag.\
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: wget the file link, std_xor need not be reversed and run the py file\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Script contains the following code -

```
import random

def str_xor(secret, key):
    #extend key to secret length
    new_key = key
    i = 0
    while len(new_key) < len(secret):
        new_key = new_key + key[i]
        i = (i + 1) % len(key)        
    return "".join([chr(ord(secret_c) ^ ord(new_key_c)) for (secret_c,new_key_c) in zip(secret,new_key)])


flag_enc = chr(0x15) + chr(0x07) + chr(0x08) + chr(0x06) + chr(0x27) + chr(0x21) + chr(0x23) + chr(0x15) + chr(0x5f) + chr(0x05) + chr(0x08) + chr(0x2a) + chr(0x1c) + chr(0x5e) + chr(0x1e) + chr(0x1b) + chr(0x3b) + chr(0x17) + chr(0x51) + chr(0x5b) + chr(0x58) + chr(0x5c) + chr(0x3b) + chr(0x42) + chr(0x53) + chr(0x5c) + chr(0x0d) + chr(0x5e) + chr(0x50) + chr(0x4d) + chr(0x00) + chr(0x13)


num = random.choice(range(10,101))

print('If ' + str(num) + ' is in decimal base, what is it in binary base?')

ans = input('Answer: ')

try:
  ans_num = int(ans, base=2)
  
  if ans_num == num:
    flag = str_xor(flag_enc, 'enkidu')
    print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
  else:
    print(str(ans_num) + ' and ' + str(num) + ' are not equal.')
  
except ValueError:
  print('That isn\'t a binary number. Binary numbers contain only 1\'s and 0\'s')
```

Just running the file and answering correctly for binary equivalent of decimal number gives the flag. Flag is captured. 
Inside the file however.. the str_xor function performs a complex operation. Looks interesting! 

#### (17) fixme1.py
<span style="color: red;">Description</span>: Fix the syntax error in this Python script to print the flag.\
<span style="color: yellow;">Hints</span>: Indentation is important\
<span style="color: green;">Solution</span>: Last line has unexpected whitespace at the beginning. Removing it and runnig the file -> Flag is captured.

So, this is the first batch of all the general categorised picoCTF activities. Most were easy and quick to complete. Should get it going for more tough problems and challenges.
