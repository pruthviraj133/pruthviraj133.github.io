<span class="color-green">**Objective of the survey**</span>: How to avail formal banking services to female street vendors? Do they avail loans from banks? Do they use banking services?

Some insights where survey questions failed to make note were observed.

**Survey Conducted** : (1) KR Flower Market, KR Market (2) 8th Cross, Malleshwaram (3) HSR Layout on 17/04/2023, 18/04/2023 and 19/04/2023 respectively \
**Target Demographics**: Women Street Vendors \
**Sample Size** (Data Set based on personal experience): ~50

> Which do working street vending women want what? 
> each person felt like a basket case.. but they all had a lot in common.

> Priority for their Loans: Why do they take up loans? - Children's Education, Girl Child Marriage - which is prioritised when? Some women SVs even say they need to build a house back in their native.

> Depends on their priority..

- Most of the data here are not numerically accurate figures.. but instead are rough estimate and conversational feedback.
	- No analysis done - no charts and graphs. Just rough percentages. 
- All the vendors from first 2 locations were in high density shopping areas, most of their per-day income is very high - 2,000 to 5,000; touches up to 10,000 during festive season. The third location (HSR Layout) was a quasi residential area - per-day income was 1,000 to 2,000; 5,000 during festive season. (for flower vendors)
	- Other parts of Bengaluru (BLR) where vendors mostly work in residential areas, street vendors might have slightly less income - but likely they might be making good money too
- This might be misunderstood as bias but most of the women vendors while targeting to get their information happened to work as flower sellers and Vegetable and fruit sellers (maybe it mirrors society's thinking - helps to have women vendors with tackling aggressive negotiations from women customers - or, women feel much better to buy household materials from women - hence mostly women buy flowers from women)

So, to begin with

The questionnaire could have been so much better. The order of the questions is bad. No one asks their Name and Age to begin with - it's not crime patrol and we're not investigating them. 

Even if some questions were right, the options available were incorrect. Needed another option where custom data could have been entered.

### New order for existing Questions 
keeping it like a conversation - loan subject is touchy - need to come back it once in a while, when asking questions - will help the vendors know we (from RBI) are not here to sell them anything

Also keeping the surveyors (who can speak local language) as young as possible, but older yet confident personalities as possible will help them open up and talk more openly with them. They will have a notion that young people will have little to less knowledge about them, so they will explain about their situation like they are explaining to their children.

Many more questions could have been asked regarding their financial status, lifestyle, financial situation and financial habits.

But this cannot be a full blown case study / interview since it would affect their business. The entire questionnaire must be within 4-5 mins if possible. If they are enthusiastic, it will extent maximum 20 minutes, worst case 30 minutes.

---
My Opening statement while asking them about themselves and their business went like this - 
"Namaskara Madam! I'm from Reserve Bank and I have few questions regarding your *vyapaara* (business). I wanted to know how your financial situation is right now and explore how banks can help you alleviate your problems by better loan servicing. I have just some 10 questions, can I ask you?"

Behavioural Responses vary - 
1. Most women say in a straightforward manner "Ok" (~55%)
2. some women feel shy and blush and hesitantly say "Ok" (~20%)
3. some women feel shy and blush and hesitantly say "please ask some other people around" - but I press once and shoot my shot with opening question - "how long have you been working here?" - and they start answering one by one (~15%)
4. some women feel annoyed, threatened and say "please ask the men around", with a non-cooperative tone (~5%) (and I back away)
5. some downright reject (~5%)

Most women who we talked with willingly wanted to express their situation and sought answers. A small amount of vendors expected after the questions, reserve bank would provide loans! 

After such activity, vendors end up having some expectations - that a solution will present itself in the near future. But if no such solution is rolled out and repeatedly surveys are conducted without any change, they might end up being non-cooperative to future surveyors and make their work difficult.

### Demography
Street Vendors in KR Market - 
- Almost all of the women there are migrants, from villages mostly in TN. Either born there and earning a living here. Or they are born and raised in BLR, their parents are migrants from TN - have been here in BLR working as street vendors and they continued their profession by taking their place
- Apart form vegetables and fruits & flowers, male street vendors sold everything else 

Street Vendors in 8th Cross Malleshwaram - 
- Most women are born and raised in Karnataka, working here for over 10-30 years (~40%)
- Some women street vendors are migrants:
	- Some women who sell vegetables are actually from TN - born and raised. They are the wives of few migrants men who shifted to BLR and take up jobs like these to support household financially. (~40%)
	- Some women are from Andra Pradesh (~5-10%)

Street Vendors in HSR Layout - 
- Some women are from Karnataka (~50%)
- Some are from TN (~50%)

### Their Bank account situation
`Do you have a bank account?` The answer is much more complex than a simple Y/N.
Around 80% of enquired women had bank account.

Catch 
- The women street vendors who didn't have bank account - had UPI payment option enabled at her stall - it was either their husband or children's account and any transaction message goes to their support person
- The women street vendors who had bank accounts but didn't have it here in BLR. Mostly they had it in their native villages (due to less interest rate for loans and high cost of living here in Bangalore) (it's also required to keep a particular minimum amount in the account here in BLR - but in her native "zero balance" account option exists)
- The women who had UPI but didn't have it for their bank account since it is based in her home native town/village. To avail any monetary services she has to take help from her husband or children's account (which is here in BLR, near their business place or house) for UPI

### Their resources and environment
Around ~40% of the women had smart phone. The more young the women are, more chances of them owning owning a smart phone (but there were cases where some 30-40 year olds who used keypad phones).

Most people had been used to getting their loan amount from "finance" people (Informal Moneylenders).
And women from KR Flower Market and Malleshwaram were comfortable with it. 
Some men in KR Market even said that "they pay a loan by taking another loan"

But not in the 3rd location (HSR Layout) - many were averse to loans - either bank or "finance" people. Only if it was absolutely necessary - then they would reach out to "finance" people - this absolute necessity included reasons mostly either children school fees or untimely calamity. Savings was their only option.

Most vendors haven't been approved to get a loan, and due to this nature of working - they don't opt for banks. 
The first hurdle is the toughest one. Once that's cleared they will be informed of the internal options for loan options.

Which is why the part of the questionnaire where `if banks offer loans more easily what are you seeking?` is a very redundant question. Some cannot even believe in their wildest imagination that it would be possible. Forget the terms of loan repayment.

> Some women still were affected by covid lockdown. Their business revenue is still very low and were seeking loans from survey questioner even though after explicitly telling here that it was just a some questions.

> One such temple street vendor for religious items was repeateldy asking for which loan can she avail with some desperation. She went on to describe the business was low due to less demand and less exposure of her shop post sunset due to migrant labourers occupation of main road post working hours - blocking customers' visibility and access to her shop - reducing sales drastically.

> But this might be incorrect data from an untrustworthy source.. they might be doing just fine and were probably looking for some way to phish "bank" employees for easier loan approval.


### Their Knowledge
Very few women were knowledgeable about smart phones, banks and their processes (only those that were averse to "finance" people's practices and bet on being safe with banks - mostly public or private banks). 

It was rare encounter of women who knew centre availed schemes. But no one knew about PM Svanidhi Yojana.

> Those who have experience with loans compare interest rates the next time they take loans, with banks' loan offers and informal moneylenders' loan offer. Based on their comparison/analysis and decision - some opt for banks the next time due to lower interest rates.

> Prefer savings / Not comfortable with anybody else >> (compulsion, immenent requirement) >> money lenders / Not comfortable with banks >> (used to loans, require better services) >> lesser interest rates of banks >> (drive/will to save money) >> learning of the complex end to end process of banks >> (once learnt, they'll try availing other options) >> availing govt schemes 


### Their Behaviour 
Most of the women street vendors' preferred source is informal money lenders. (~90% in location 1 & 2, some ~20% in location 3)

Since most women street vendors say that they cannot remember when to repay their loan, either on a day per week or a day per month. 
- Which day? If not paid, will they be subjected to threats and other untoward situations?
- The amount to be paid per month is also a big number to them, they are unsure that it'll remain safe with them - either in their hands or in their bank account.

So they opt for daily loan repayment option and they are used to it, very much.

Street vendors are used to repaying loans in a particular method now. For 20,000 or 50,000 or 1,00,000 - a daily premium of 250 to 500 to 1000 is decided for a stipulated period of time (either 30 to 50 to 100 days). That way they don't forget their payments. 

If it can't be done, the "finance" people have a track of their repayment patterns (an informal credit behaviour?) and since they keep seeing them everyday anyway - a connection exists between the payer and the payee. This establishes trust between them which helps them seek more loans in the future.

| daily payment                            | need to pay in regular intervals - which is long enough to forget                               |

### Reaction to "time" variable
When they were asked about their expectation of Turn-around-time (TAT) from banks for loan approval - most women and men's answer was quite protective - that they would pay them as soon as possible, when they can. (i.e., they misunderstand it - if anyone asks loan related question with time variable - their answer is I'll pay as soon as I can)

The question was not right since any sentence with "money", "banks" and "**time**" was put out there - the street vendors thought of repayment, instead of how soon should the banks deliver their loan amount (TAT).
After a slow explanation, they would give say 1 week is ok. (since "finance" people's would give them their amount (TAT) normally in 2-7 days)

So if I ask them, 
can banks give you money in one week? "yes"
can banks give you money in one day? "yes"
can banks give you money in one hour? "just give me the money please"

Simple documentation process is extremely necessary. The entire loan approval process in an unknown and untethered place with extensive amount of documents makes the women in a foreign environment - speaking English words for objects which she has not much idea about. The entire end to end process also needs to be simplified.

Nearly Half the correspondents said that they would be fine with end-to-end digital process where the repayment would be directly cut from her bank account. (but the women who answered so were mostly young - around 30-45 years of age; they had smartphones and showed to have some phone usage capability)

The ones who were in disagreement with the idea were suggesting the reason as - security of their money is much more important compared to convenience.

### Reaction to "finance" people
Their enthusiasm while talking about banks and "finance" people was also contrasting. Those who had taken prior loans talked with confidence about "finance" people and when the conversation changed to banks, their enthusiasm would falter.

### Measures to be taken 
Room for improvement
- Easing the loan approval process, documentation verification and low TAT and 
- replicate the successful methods followed by Informal Money lenders

Utilizing infrastructure of banks to create a minimum-to-nil-interaction application (like weather application) for letting the Street Vendors know 
- digital option of daily repayment should be availed
- visibility of how much got deducted, when it got deducted (with an option of not paying for a few days must also be made available)
- visibility of what the their loan repayment status is, would be helpful for them. 
	- duolingo widget idea duplication - shows status of candidate on homepage of smart phone - no need to open app to view what's the status 
		- but this might prove aversive - will keep reminding them that they have balance amount to pay

If any grievances are present, 
- a hotline with operators catering to specific geographic area, with interaction in their mother tongue could be seen; these telephonic operators (must be female) can have a hybrid option of work - a desk job and physical grievance addressal of women street vendors in their allotted area
- operators must develop a rapport and familiarity with women street vendors; that way they are easier to approach and female street vendors develop a positive attitude to banks (highly dependant on implementation of local banks)

Failure to repay loans does occurs more often than required. Banks must have a profile database for blacklisting such customers. They must be banned from availing such services but after some period, reaching out to them for availing financial good habits training facilities can be introduced for public goodwill? 

Such a corrective solution with the ministry of human resource development department can look into people with non-repayable loans background - can change their habits for better lifestyle. If government fails, indirect positive habits and practices can be addressal to people with influence campaigns from religious, and populist figures and institutions for people's wellbeing.

<!--Nope, no solutions from my side.-->

### Conclusion
This scheme of PM Svanidhi is technically not possible to serve the people, since the people working in this profession are not here for long term.

This section of society move from one odd job to another. Especially Male street vendors, since they keep moving around, trying to find jobs that **just pay money**. 

They cannot work in one place for a long time - maybe this averse mindset comes in when they were forced to sit in one classroom for a long period of time in schools and bad experiences from untrained teachers in schools.

Or sometimes they cannot afford to stay at one place for a long time due to external factors like 
- getting into bad blood with people around their house/house owners
- absconding after non-repayment of loans to moneylenders

Female vendors are seen to work in one place, under one business for a longer period of time. Either they are secondary bread winners or most probably primary supporters in their family. Focusing on meeting their needs could be effective way of the scheme.

<!--
This scheme also feels like it's been brought in as populist measures for the current political administration instead of addressing the core problems of people.

1 > What's the word about the PM on the street?
2 > idk, but since you said "PM" and "street" did you hear about the new scheme the govt launched?
