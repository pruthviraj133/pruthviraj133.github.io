MyDFIR's SIEM/XDR + SOAR integration project -> SOAR + Digital Forensics + Sigma/YARA

Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) is a stack of compatible software programs that enables an organization to collect data about security threats and respond to security events without human assistance. It is the process of executing these tasks—such as scanning for vulnerabilities, or searching for logs—without human intervention.

SOAR capabilities include:
-   The prioritization of potential threats.  
-   Assessing potential impact.  
-   Triaging the most important threats.
-   Responding to the threats accordingly.

Aspects of those capabilities are:
- Security orchestration and automation to create a strong security foundation, based on best practices.
- Security incident response platform to use as a tool for orchestrated security responses, establishing repeatable and scalable workflows.
- Threat intelligence usage to understand threats preemptively, accelerating prioritization, and after a security threat to confirm the incident is resolved.

SOAR tools provide machine-powered assistance to human analysts to improve the efficiency and consistency of people and processes by significantly enhancing security operations activities like threat detection and response.

The goal of using a SOAR platform is to improve the efficiency of physical and digital security operations. They streamline security operations in three key areas: threat and vulnerability management, incident response, and security operations automation.

Top SOAR vendors in 2023 from multiple Gartner (research and consulting firm) lists and other researchers' watchlist include 

1. PhishER, 
2. Swimlane, 
3. Chronicle SOAR, (offered by Google)

### Benefits
- SOAR helps build workflows & streamline operations
- SOAR helps increase flexibility, extensibility, and collaboration
- Respond more quickly and accurately
- Improve analyst job satisfaction
- Improve time management and productivity
- Effectively manage incidents
- Automate repeated and error-prone tasks
- Simplify collaboration across operational teams

### Usefulness in SOC Environments
Compared to Security Incident and Event Management Solutions (SIEM), SOAR programs are often automated and typically do not require a large degree of expert human oversight to determine if the security events are false positives or actual incidents that require investigation. Time spent investigating and mitigating can be used much more efficiently and usefully.

SIEM tools typically need a degree of calibration and oversight to determine the accuracy of the data collected and to triage the more important data, which can be labor intensive.

Goal of such SOAR systems entail to:
1. reduce the resolution time to minimum
2. maximize analyst efficiency
3. maximize the increase in solution handled incidents 

Success with security is ideally the combination of SIEM and SOAR. A lot is dependent on the size and type of data gathered around events, and a larger organization could receive up to millions of alerts a day, which a SIEM will gather and analyze. 

But a lot of data analysis is required to process through all of the data, which is where SOAR can be used in conjunction with a SIEM to process and manage incident response much faster, removing the time consuming and laborious manual incident prioritization and response processes.

Threat hunting is a proactive approach to cybersecurity that involves searching for signs of malicious activity within an organization's network. One of the tools that security professionals use in their threat hunting efforts are Sigma rules and Yara rules.

Sigma is a tool for the open sharing and crowdsourcing of threat intelligence, it focuses on SIEM instead of files or network traffic. 

Snort is an open sourse IPS/IDS, uses rules based language combining signature, profile, anamaly inspection methods to detect malicious activity. What Snort is to network traffic, and YARA is to files, Sigma is to logs.

## Sigma Rules

Sigma is an open-source tool that can be used to detect and analyze security incidents. It uses a standardized rule format to describe various threat indicators, such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domains. These rules can be used to identify potential security threats and to create custom detections for specific use cases.

One of the key benefits of Sigma is its simplicity. The rule format is easy to understand and write, making it accessible to security professionals who may not have extensive programming experience. Additionally, Sigma has a large and active community of users who contribute new rules and provide feedback, which helps to keep the tool up-to-date and effective.

### Use Cases
- Malware Detection: Sigma can be used to detect various types of malware, such as ransomware, trojans, and worms. The tool can identify known indicators of malicious activity and provide alerts to security teams.
- Data Exfiltration: Sigma can be used to detect when sensitive data is being exfiltrated from an organization's network. This can help to prevent data loss and protect against data breaches.
- Phishing Detection: Sigma can be used to detect phishing attempts and prevent sensitive information from being stolen. The tool can identify indicators of phishing emails, such as suspicious domains and fake login pages.

Sigma rules can be converted into a search query specific to your SIEM solution and supports various solutions: Splunk, ElasticSearch Query Strings and DSL, Kibana, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (MDATP), Azure Sentinel, QRadar, LogPoint, Qualys, RSA NetWitness, LimaCharlie, ArcSight, PowerShell and Grep.

Sigma is an open-source project with three major components:
- A language specification for the generic Sigma rule format.
- Open repository for sigma signatures with **over one thousand rules for several attacker behaviours and techniques**.
- `sigmac`, a conversion utility to generate search queries for different SIEM systems from Sigma rules.

![](/assets/images/sigma_yara/Sigma-description.png)

A Sigma rule is written in YAML and defines the what and the where to look in system logs. Every Sigma rule also specifies metadata such as the author of the rule, a unique rule identifier (UUID), MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and references, eg. an URL for additional information.

Taking a look at a sigma rule from the repository `rules/linux/builtin/lnx_pwnkit_local_privilege_escalation.yml` from the github repo, https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma.git 
This rule detects the privilege escalation vulnerability, PwnKit.

## Yara Rules

Yara is a tool that can be used to scan files and identify patterns that match known malware or other security threats. Yara rules are written in a custom syntax and describe the characteristics of malicious files, such as specific strings of code, file signatures, and other identifying information.

One of the key benefits of Yara is its versatility. The tool can be used to identify a wide range of security threats, including malware, viruses, and other types of malicious software. Additionally, Yara has a large and active community of users who contribute new rules and provide feedback, which helps to keep the tool up-to-date and effective.

### Use Cases

- Malware Identification: Yara can be used to identify specific types of malware, such as Trojans, worms, and other malicious software. The tool can help security teams understand the nature and scope of an attack, and take appropriate action.
- File Scanning: Yara can be used to scan large volumes of files and identify those that match known malware signatures. This can help organizations to quickly identify and isolate infected files, and prevent the spread of malware within their networks.
- Threat Intelligence: Yara can be used to gather threat intelligence, such as the origins of specific malware samples, the techniques used by attackers, and the systems and networks that are most at risk. This information can be used to inform security strategies and to better prepare organizations for future attacks.

YARA rules are like a piece of programming language, they work by defining a number of variables that contain patterns found in a sample of malware. If some or all of the conditions are met, depending on the rule, then it can be used to successfully identify a piece of malware.

Structure of YARA rule:
```
rule MyFirstYaraRule
{
    strings:
        $my_text_string = "text here"
        $my_hex_string = { E2 34 A1 C8 23 FB }

    condition:
        $my_text_string or $my_hex_string
}
```
The word rule here is a reserved word that shows the start of a Yara rule. The string MyFirstYaraRule is the name that you choose for your Yara rule. It is a good idea to write a meaningful name to recognize it later when we are looking at the results based on multiple Yara rule hits.

The string: section defines strings (HEX strings as well) that you want to search for (usually based on your logic of identifying a malicious file). You can have as many strings as you want.

The condition: section defines the conditions that you want to check so that your Yara rules can trigger a match. The above sample rule is checking for any of the strings defined in the strings: section. However, it is not limited to this condition only. We can make our condition to match for file size, its type (such as MZ or executable), different combinations of (AND/ OR conditions), and many more.

In conclusion, Sigma and Yara rules can be powerful tools in the threat hunting process. By providing organizations with the ability to identify potential security threats and respond quickly, these tools can help to minimize the risk of data loss and protect against malicious activity.

Digital forensics is the scientific process of identifying, collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence for the purpose of investigating digital-related crimes, incidents, or civil litigation. It involves the use of specialized techniques and tools to recover, preserve, and analyze digital data from a wide range of devices, including computers, mobile phones, servers, storage media, and other digital systems. The goal of digital forensics is to uncover and preserve evidence that can be used in court or in other legal proceedings, and to provide impartial and reliable information about digital events or activities.

The fundamentals of digital forensics include:

1.  Evidence preservation and collection
2.  Identification and documentation of digital evidence
3.  Analysis of digital data (e.g. computers, mobile devices, storage media)
	- Digital data is analyzed through a combination of technical and analytical processes. The specific techniques and tools used for digital data analysis will vary depending on the type of data and the goals of the analysis, but the overall process involves the systematic examination and interpretation of digital data to uncover relevant information and patterns. The general steps involved in digital data analysis are:
		1.  Data acquisition: The first step is to acquire a copy of the digital data to be analyzed. This can be done through a variety of methods, including direct access to the source device, imaging of the storage media, or other methods.
		2.  Data preservation: The acquired data is preserved in a manner that prevents any alteration or corruption of the original data.
		3.  Data filtering: The acquired data is filtered to remove any irrelevant or unnecessary information, reducing the amount of data to be analyzed.
		4.  Data analysis: The filtered data is then analyzed using specialized tools and techniques, such as file carving, data carving, keyword searches, pattern analysis, and others. The goal of this step is to uncover relevant information and patterns in the data.
		5.  Data interpretation: The results of the analysis are interpreted to determine the significance and relevance of the data to the investigation or case.
		6.  Report generation: A report is generated that summarizes the results of the analysis, including any relevant findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
4.  Recovery of deleted or hidden data
	- Recovering deleted or hidden data can be a complex process that requires specialized tools and techniques. It is important to note that the likelihood of successful data recovery will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of storage media, the method of deletion or hiding, the length of time since the data was deleted or hidden, and other factors. The exact steps involved in data recovery will depend on the specific situation, but some general steps are:
		1.  Data acquisition: The first step is to acquire a copy of the storage media containing the deleted or hidden data. This can be done through imaging or cloning the storage media.
		2.  Data analysis: The acquired data is analyzed using specialized data recovery software or hardware tools to search for deleted or hidden data. The tools can search for data using various methods, such as file carving, data carving, and unallocated space analysis.
		3.  File system analysis: The file system of the storage media is analyzed to determine the location of deleted or hidden data, such as deleted files, unallocated space, slack space, or other areas.
		4.  Data recovery: The recovered data is then restored to a new storage device or a location on the original storage media, if possible.
		5.  Data verification: The recovered data is verified to ensure its integrity and authenticity, and to confirm that the data is complete and usable.
5.  Authentication and validation of digital evidence
	- The authentication and validation of digital evidence is done through a combination of technical and legal processes. It involves the following steps:
		1.  Preservation: The first step is to preserve the digital evidence in a manner that prevents any alteration or corruption of the data.
		2.  Hashing: A unique digital signature, called a hash value, is generated for the original data using a hashing algorithm. This allows the authenticity of the evidence to be verified at a later time
		3.  Chain of custody: A record is kept of who had access to the evidence, when, and for what purpose, to establish the chain of custody. This helps to demonstrate that the evidence has not been altered or tampered with
		4.  Analysis: The digital evidence is analyzed using specialized tools and techniques to determine its authenticity and validity. This can include comparing the hash values of the original and analyzed data, as well as examining file metadata, timestamps, and other information
		5.  Expert testimony: In court or other legal proceedings, an expert witness can be called upon to provide testimony regarding the authenticity and validity of the digital evidence. The expert witness will use the results of the analysis and other information to support their testimony.
6.  Presentation of findings in a court of law.

Digital forensic analysis involves the use of scientific and technical methods to examine and analyze digital devices and data to uncover, collect, and preserve evidence for legal purposes.

Types of digital forensics include:

1.  Computer forensics
2.  Mobile device forensics
3.  Network forensics
4.  Database forensics
5.  Cloud forensics
6.  Memory forensics
7.  Forensic data analysis
8.  Internet of Things (IoT) forensics
9.  Audio/Video forensics
10.  Malware forensics
